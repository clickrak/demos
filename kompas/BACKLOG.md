# Kompas backlog

Small, self-contained jobs left after the review of 13 Nov 2026 (Studia v1.1.2, Liceum v1.8.2).
Each one is mostly data entry or a small screen change. None needs new scoring logic.
Do them one at a time, in any order. Priority: **P1** helps the kids most, **P3** is tidying.

## Rules for every task

1. **No personal data** in this repo (it is public). No names, marks or answers of real people, also not in tests or examples.
2. **No new network calls** when the app runs. Allowed today: OpenStreetMap map tiles in Liceum, and links that open only when tapped.
   No analytics, no cookies, no browser storage, no CDN scripts or fonts.
3. **Every fact needs a source.** Add the page to the app's `data/sources.json` (`id`, `url`, `title`, `asOf` as `YYYY-MM`, `status`)
   and point to it with `sourceId`. If you cannot confirm a fact on an official page, do not invent it: leave the field empty
   or keep `"status": "check"`.
4. **Do not change scoring** (`core/scoring.js`, `liceum/points.js`, weights in `config.json`) unless the task says so.
5. **Polish only, simple words.** Text is read by a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old. Short sentences. No grading tone
   ("to nie test"). Kids do not want to write: prefer chips, sliders and taps over text fields.
6. **Check before you commit**, from the repo root:
   ```
   node kompas/tests/syntax.mjs && node kompas/tests/run.mjs && node kompas/tests/liceum.mjs
   ```
   All three must exit with 0. Then open the changed screen at 375 px and 1280 px wide in all three looks
   (`?skin=neon`, `?skin=pop`, none) and make sure nothing is wider than the screen.
   Test people are under "Tryb testowy" on the start screen when the address has `?test`.
7. **After data changes** set `dataVersion` in that app's `data/config.json` to today's date. After screen changes raise the
   last number of `appVersion` and the same number in that app's `index.html` (two places) and in line 1 of `app.js`.
8. One task = one commit. Say in the commit message which task (for example `Kompas backlog D1`).

## Data tasks

### D1 (P1) Studia: local demand for 17 areas
**Why.** 9 of 26 areas say how the Kraków job market looks ("deficyt", "równowaga"…). The other 17 show nothing.
**Areas without it:** rehabilitacja, farmacja, dane-medyczne, inz-biomed, sport, atom, cyber, automatyka, obronnosc, ukraina, ue,
logistyka, woda, laboratorium, media, handel, projektowanie.
**Steps.**
1. Use the newest "Barometr zawodów" for Kraków / Małopolska (barometrzawodow.pl) or the Kraków labour office report already
   used (`sourceId: "krk-orp-2026"`). Add a new source entry if you use a new page.
2. For each area add, next to `whyNeeded`:
   `"demand": { "level": "deficyt" | "równowaga" | "nadwyżka" | "mieszany", "text": "<one plain sentence about Kraków>", "sourceId": "<id>" }`
   Copy the style of `medycyna`. Use "mieszany" when the jobs inside one area differ.
3. If the report has no matching job, skip that area and list it in the commit message.
**Done when** each of the 17 has `demand` or is listed as "no data", and tests pass.

### D2 (P1) Liceum: four missing school addresses
**Schools:** `lo1`, `lo7`, `lo14`, `lo44` have `"address": null`. The "Dojazd" button then searches by school name only.
**Steps.** Take the address from the school's own website or BIP. Write it like the others: `"ul. Grzegórzecka 24, 31-531 Kraków"`.
Do not touch `geo`.
**Done when** no school has an empty address.

### D3 (P2) Liceum: school websites
**Why.** The plan says "wejdź na stronę szkoły", but the app has no link.
**Steps.**
1. Add `"www": "https://…"` to each of the 48 schools (official site only, `https` when it exists).
2. In `kompas/liceum/app.js`, function `schoolCard` (search `class="scard`), show a small link next to the address:
   `<a href="…" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strona szkoły</a>`, only when `www` is set. Pass the value through `esc()`.
3. In `kompas/tests/syntax.mjs` add a check that every `www` starts with `https://` or `http://`.
**Done when** every school card with a known site shows the link, and it opens in a new tab.

### D4 (P2) Liceum: confirm class data
**Now:** 225 classes; 205 have `"status": "check"`, 45 have no `threshold` (41 in licea, 4 in technika), 80 have no `scored` list.
**Steps (five schools per commit).**
1. Open the school's recruitment page for 2027/28. If it is not published yet, use 2026/27 and keep `"status": "check"`.
2. For each class check: `code`, `label`, `extended` (extended subjects), `scored` (the four subjects counted from the certificate),
   `threshold` and `thresholdYear` (lowest points admitted last year).
3. Subject words to use in `extended` and `scored`: `polski`, `matematyka`, `angielski`, `fizyka`, `informatyka`, `biologia`,
   `chemia`, `geografia`, `historia`, `wos`. Other languages: `j. niemiecki`, `j. francuski`, `j. hiszpański`, `j. włoski`.
4. When everything in a class is confirmed on an official page: `"status": "sourced"`, `"scoredSourced": true`, and `sourceId`
   pointing to that page.
**Done when** the commit message says how many classes moved from "check" to "sourced". Never guess a threshold.

### D5 (P3) Liceum: one spelling for subjects
**Now:** `extended` mixes `angielski` (74×) with `j. angielski` (52×), and `j. polski` (29×) with `język polski` (15×).
The code copes with it (see `scoredSubjects` in `liceum/points.js`), but the data is untidy.
**Steps.** Replace `j. angielski` → `angielski`, `j. polski` and `język polski` → `polski` in `extended` only. Change nothing else.
**Done when** `node kompas/tests/liceum.mjs` prints the same compass lines as before the change.

### D6 (P3) Sources nobody uses
**Studia:** otou-asp-aw, otou-dziennikarstwo-krk, otou-matura, otou-medyczne-krk, uj-kampus, uj-zasady-2026, zse1-bip.
**Liceum:** kurator-kryteria, lo7-oddzialy, otou-harmonogram-2026, otou-punkty, otou-tl14-klasy, radio-2023, zschk-klasy.
**Steps.** For each id search the app folder. If nothing points to it, either attach it where it belongs (for example
`lo7-oddzialy` to the lo7 classes, if the page really covers them) or delete the entry.
**Done when** every source is used at least once. Add that check to `kompas/tests/syntax.mjs`.

### D7 (P3) Studia: newer pay data
**Now:** pay bands (`pay.band` 1–3, `pay.group`) come from GUS, October 2020 (`sourceId: "gus-2020"`).
**Steps.** Find the newest GUS "Struktura wynagrodzeń według zawodów" (published every two years). For each `pay.group` look
up the average pay and compare it with the average for all jobs in the same table. Keep the band a card has now unless the new
table clearly moves that group (band 1 = clearly below the average, 2 = near it, 3 = clearly above). Add the new source and
update `sourceId`. The words "GUS, październik 2020" are written by hand in `studia/app.js` (`payHtml`) and `core/export.js`:
search for `październik 2020` and change both to the new month and year.
**Done when** all cards with `pay` point to the new source, or the task is closed with a note that no newer table exists.

### D8 (P3) Studia: check one offer
Confirm on the University of Agriculture (URK) site that "Inżynieria i gospodarka wodna" still recruits for 2027/28, and that
its entry in `offers.json` (subjects, length, link) matches. Fix or mark `"status": "check"`.

## Small screen tasks (little logic)

### U1 (P1) Studia: minutes from home as chips
**Where.** `kompas/studia/app.js`, screen "Gdzie chcesz być potrzebny?" (search `data-field="startMin"`). It is a number field.
**Do.** Replace it with chips: `10`, `20`, `30`, `45`, `60`, `90 min`. A tap sets `A.startMin`. Keep the same question text.
Use the existing `chip()` helper and the `data-set="startMin" data-val="30"` pattern used for `privateOk` on the same screen
(check that the handler stores a number; `commute()` does `Number(A.startMin)`, so a string is fine too).
**Done when** the screen has no keyboard input and the commute times in the results still change with the choice.

### U2 (P1) Studia: tap ideas for the three reflection questions
**Where.** `vReflection` in `kompas/studia/app.js`; questions are in `questions.json` → `reflection` (f1, f2, f3).
**Do.** Add to each question in the data a list `"ideas": ["…", "…"]` (5–6 short answers a teenager could tap, for f1 for example
"w sporcie", "grając", "przy muzyce", "pomagając komuś", "ucząc się czegoś nowego"). Show them as chips above the text area.
A tap writes the idea into `A.reflection[q.id]` (tap again = clear). Keep the text area for kids who want to write.
**Done when** all three questions can be answered without typing and the answers appear in the exported file as before.

### U3 (P2) Studia: tap ideas for "Mogę to zrobić, bo…"
**Where.** `data-field="canDo"` (two places in `kompas/studia/app.js`).
**Do.** Under the field show 3 chips built from his own answers, for example
`bo umiem: ${first strength}`, `bo ważne jest dla mnie: ${first value}`, `bo już to robię ${where}`. A tap fills the field.
**Done when** the sentence can be chosen with one tap and still edited by hand.

### U4 (P2) Studia: sport as chips
**Where.** `data-field="sport"` on the "Języki i sport" screen.
**Do.** Chips: siłownia, bieganie, piłka, pływanie, wspinaczka, rower, sztuki walki, taniec, inne, nie trenuję (many can be on).
Store them joined with ", " in `A.sport`, so the export and old files keep working. Keep a short optional text field.

### U5 (P2) Studia: shorter strengths screen on phones
**Now.** After picking 5 strengths, the phone screen shows 5 blocks × 6 chips and is long.
**Do.** Show the "gdzie to widać?" block only for strengths without an answer, plus a one-line summary for the answered ones
(`Języki · w szkole  [zmień]`). `[zmień]` clears `proof` for that strength.
**Done when** a fully answered screen fits in about two phone screens.

### U6 (P3) Liceum: return to the same screen after loading a file
**Now.** Loading a saved file opens the first unanswered step, or the compass. Studia remembers the exact screen (`A.lastScreen`).
**Do.** Copy that idea: store `A.lastScreen` on every screen change, use it in `loadFile` when it is a known screen.

### U7 (P3) Both: read all texts once for tone
Read every screen as the kid would. Fix long sentences, formal words and any sentence that sounds like a grade.
Do not change meaning or numbers. One commit per app, list the changed sentences in the message.

## Not for the cheap agent (needs a decision first)

- Bilingual and sports classes in Liceum (separate entry tests).
- Exact points mode as the default in the second semester.
- Map tiles without OpenStreetMap (a static picture of Kraków) if "no outside calls at all" should also cover the map.
- Germany / abroad paths (kept open, low priority).
